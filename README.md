# Gabriel Carson â€” Resume Site

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gabriel Carson, a student, developer, and aspiring Cloud Engineer with a passion for building things that are clean, fast, and purposeful. This site is my personal resume â€” a snapshot of who I am, what Iâ€™ve worked on, and where Iâ€™m headed.

I built this site using modern web tools like Next.js and Tailwind CSS to keep things simple, responsive, and easy to maintain. Itâ€™s designed to highlight my experience, education, and projects in a way thatâ€™s both professional and approachable.

## About This Site

- Itâ€™s fully responsive (works great on mobile and desktop)
- Built as a single-page app for speed and simplicity
- Easy to update as I grow and take on new opportunities
