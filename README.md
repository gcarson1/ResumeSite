# Gabriel Carson — Resume Site

Hey there! 👋 I'm Gabriel Carson, a student, developer, and aspiring Cloud Engineer with a passion for building things that are clean, fast, and purposeful. This site is my personal resume — a snapshot of who I am, what I’ve worked on, and where I’m headed.

I built this site using modern web tools like Next.js and Tailwind CSS to keep things simple, responsive, and easy to maintain. It’s designed to highlight my experience, education, and projects in a way that’s both professional and approachable.

## 💼 About This Site

- It’s fully responsive (works great on mobile and desktop)
- Built as a single-page app for speed and simplicity
- Easy to update as I grow and take on new opportunities

## 📌 Why I Made It

I wanted a place that reflects me — not just a static resume PDF. This site gives a better sense of my style, my work, and my approach to tech. Plus, I learned a ton while building it because I wouldn't call myself a Frontend Engineer.
